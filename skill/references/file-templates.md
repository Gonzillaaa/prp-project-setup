# Project Guidelines for AI Assistant

## Project Overview

**Project**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**Description**: {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: {{LANGUAGE}}
- **Framework**: {{FRAMEWORK}}
- **Database**: {{DATABASE}}
- **ORM**: {{ORM}}
- **Package Manager**: {{PACKAGE_MANAGER}}
{{#if AI_FRAMEWORK}}
- **AI Framework**: {{AI_FRAMEWORK}}
{{/if}}

## Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described below.
{{#if VIRTUAL_ENV}}
- **Use {{VIRTUAL_ENV}}** whenever executing {{LANGUAGE}} commands.
{{/if}}

## Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than {{MAX_FILE_LENGTH}} lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code using {{CODE_ORGANIZATION}} pattern**:
{{#if CODE_ORG_BY_FEATURE}}
  ```
  src/
  ├── {{FEATURE_EXAMPLE}}/
  │   ├── models.{{EXT}}
  │   ├── services.{{EXT}}
  │   ├── routes.{{EXT}}
  │   └── tests/
  ```
{{/if}}
{{#if CODE_ORG_BY_LAYER}}
  ```
  src/
  ├── models/
  ├── services/
  ├── routes/
  └── utils/
  ```
{{/if}}
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer {{IMPORT_STYLE}} imports within packages).

## Testing & Reliability

- **Always create {{TEST_FRAMEWORK}} tests for new features**.
- **Tests should live in {{TEST_LOCATION}}** mirroring the main app structure.
- **Each test file must include at minimum**:
{{#each TEST_REQUIREMENTS}}
  - {{this}}
{{/each}}
- **Run tests before committing**: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
{{DEV_COMMAND}}

# Run tests
{{TEST_COMMAND}}

# Lint and type check
{{LINT_COMMAND}}

# Build/compile (if applicable)
{{BUILD_COMMAND}}
```

## Environment Setup

- **Environment variables**: Use {{ENV_METHOD}}
- **Required variables**: See `.env.example`
{{#if VIRTUAL_ENV}}
- **Virtual environment**: `{{VIRTUAL_ENV}}`
{{/if}}

## Style & Conventions

### Naming
- **Variables**: {{VAR_NAMING}} (e.g., `user_name` or `userName`)
- **Functions**: {{FUNC_NAMING}}
- **Classes**: {{CLASS_NAMING}}
- **Files**: {{FILE_NAMING}}
- **Constants**: {{CONST_NAMING}}

### Formatting
- **Linter**: {{LINTER}}
- **Formatter**: {{FORMATTER}}
- **Type checking**: {{TYPE_CHECKER}}

{{#if DOCSTRING_STYLE}}
### Documentation
- **Docstring style**: {{DOCSTRING_STYLE}}
- Example:
  ```{{LANGUAGE_LOWER}}

  ```
{{/if}}

## Known Gotchas

```{{LANGUAGE_LOWER}}
{{#each GOTCHAS}}
# CRITICAL: {{this.description}}
# {{this.details}}

{{/each}}
```

## AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context.** Ask questions if uncertain.
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase before inventing new approaches.
- **Run validation commands** after making changes to catch errors early.

```markdown
# Generate PRP from Feature Request

Feature File: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Read the feature request file and generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) that will guide implementation.

## Process

### Phase 1: Research
1. Read the feature request file completely
2. Analyze the existing codebase structure: `tree -I {{IGNORE_PATTERNS}}`
3. Search for similar patterns in the codebase
4. Review any referenced documentation
5. Check the examples/ folder for patterns to follow

### Phase 2: Context Gathering
1. Identify all files that need to be created or modified
2. List all external documentation URLs needed
3. Document any gotchas or known issues from CLAUDE.md
4. Find existing patterns in the codebase to follow

### Phase 3: PRP Generation

Create a comprehensive PRP using the template at `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md`

The PRP must include:
- Clear Goal with measurable success criteria
- Why section explaining business value
- What section with technical requirements
- All Needed Context with specific file/URL references
- Implementation Blueprint with ordered tasks
- Validation Loop with executable test commands

### Phase 4: Quality Check

Before saving, verify:
- [ ] All referenced files actually exist
- [ ] All URLs are accessible
- [ ] Implementation tasks are in dependency order
- [ ] Validation commands are executable in this project
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable

## Output

Save as: `PRPs/{feature-name}.md`

Rate confidence (1-10) that this PRP contains sufficient context for successful one-pass implementation.
```

## execute-prp.md Template

```markdown
# Execute PRP Implementation

PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Read and execute the specified PRP file to implement the feature.

## Execution Process

### Step 1: Load Context
- Read the entire PRP file
- Load all referenced documentation
- Review all referenced code files
- Understand the complete context before writing any code

### Step 2: Create Implementation Plan
- List all tasks from the Implementation Blueprint
- Verify dependencies are in correct order
- Identify any blockers or missing information
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

### Step 3: Execute Tasks

For each task in order:
1. Implement the task following patterns from referenced files
2. Run the relevant validation commands
3. Fix any issues found
4. Move to next task only when current passes validation

### Step 4: Validation Loop

Run all validation levels:

**Level 1: Syntax & Style**
```bash
{{LINT_COMMAND}}
```

**Level 2: Type Checking**
```bash
{{TYPE_CHECK_COMMAND}}
```

**Level 3: Unit Tests**
```bash
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
```

**Level 4: Integration Test** (if applicable)
```bash
{{INTEGRATION_TEST}}
```

### Step 5: Final Verification
- Verify all success criteria from the PRP are met
- Run any manual verification tests
- Fix any remaining issues

### Step 6: Documentation
- Update README.md if needed
- Add any discovered gotchas to CLAUDE.md
- Mark task complete in TASK.md

## Quality Gates

Do not consider complete until:
- [ ] All success criteria from the PRP are met
- [ ] All validation commands pass
- [ ] Code follows patterns from referenced examples
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] No linting or type errors
```

## prp_base.md Template

```markdown
---
name: "Base PRP Template"
description: "Template for AI agents to implement features with validation loops"
---

## Purpose

Template optimized for AI agents to implement features with sufficient context and self-validation capabilities to achieve working code through iterative refinement.

## Core Principles

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global Rules**: Follow all rules in CLAUDE.md

# Code Examples

This folder contains code examples that demonstrate patterns the AI should follow.

## How Examples Are Used

When generating or executing PRPs, the AI references these examples to:
- Understand project coding patterns
- Follow consistent structure
- Avoid reinventing existing patterns

## Examples

{{#each EXAMPLES}}
### {{this.name}}

**File**: `{{this.path}}`
**Pattern**: {{this.description}}

{{this.details}}

{{/each}}

## Adding New Examples

When you have a well-structured piece of code that should be used as a pattern:
1. Add it to this folder
2. Update this README
3. Reference it in future INITIAL.md files
```
